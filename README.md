## INTRODUCTION

Zipco Foods is a vibrant and growing business that specializes in the sales of pizzas and cakes. As a key player in the fast-casual dining industry, Zipco Foods operates numerous outlets across the country, serving a wide variety of pizzas and cakes that cater to local tastes and preferences. With a strong commitment to customer satisfaction and quality service, Zipco Foods aims to leverage advanced data engineering solutions to enhance operational efficiency, improve product offerings, and ultimately boost profitability.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT

Zipco Foods generates a significant amount of sales data daily, which is currently underutilized due to inefficient data handling and analysis processes. The primary challenge is the disparate nature of data collection and storage, with critical sales and inventory information scattered across multiple CSV files without a unified system for aggregation and analysis. This fragmentation leads to operational inefficiencies, including delays in data access, difficulty in obtaining real-time insights, and challenges in maintaining data integrity and accuracy.
